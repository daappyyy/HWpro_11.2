            There’s a famous quote I read somewhere. It says we are all given second
            chances every day of our lives. They are there for the taking, it’s just that we don’t
            usually take them.
            I spent a big chunk of my life proving that quote. I was given a lot of
            opportunities, sometimes on a daily basis. For a long time I failed to take any of
            them, but then, in the early spring of 2007, that finally began to change. It was
            then that I befriended Bob. Looking back on it, something tells me it might have
            been his second chance too.
